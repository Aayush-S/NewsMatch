They\\\\u2019re armed with seeds, soil and a range of gardening tools. Upside-down soda bottles, filled with water, outline a series of rectangular garden plots. A boy named Felipy Pigato tells me they are preparing the soil for planting. \\\\u201cYesterday we mixed regular soil with coconut fiber,\\\\u201d he says. \\\\u201cThe coconut fiber holds the seeds in the soil.\\\\u201d \\\\u00a0 Today, he says they will add in the compost. As the students dig, they pull back chunks of dirt, creating shallow pits, where earthworms wriggle in the freshly dug soil.\\\\u00a0 Mateus Feitosa de Almeida, 12, slowly pulls back the soil around a worm. \\\\u201cWe have to pull like that so we don\\\\u2019t hurt the worms,\\\\u201d he explains. \\\\u201cIf we take them out, it\\\\u2019s bad for the soil.\\\\u201d This digging is going on in a quiet middle-class neighborhood, in a garden that belongs to Le\\\\u00e3o Machado School, a large public school. The students are working under the guidance of two teachers, Daniel Giglio Colombo and Marta Martins. This is the second year of the project, says Colombo, who helped start the garden. \\\\u201cWe\\\\u2019re going to grow the same things we did last year \\\\u2014 arugula, lettuce, radishes.\\\\u201d The vegetables they grow are used in school meals. But the real aim of the school garden is not to supply ingredients, he says, but to teach students where food comes from, so they can develop a connection to their food. \\\\u201cWhen we ask students where lettuce comes from, they say the market,\\\\u201d Colombo says. \\\\u201cThey have lost contact with nature, the soil, sowing, and growing of crops.\\\\u201d And that is reflected in their diets, he says, which are increasingly unhealthy.  Students say the school garden project is teaching them a lot about how to grow food, though it\\'s still hard for some of them to appreciate vegetables. Rhitu Chatterjee Just like in the US, highly processed foods like fast food, soda, and high-fructose corn syrup have become all too popular here in Brazil. And obesity rates are rising, even among children. It is a nation-wide problem that has alarmed the government and public health experts in the country.\\\\u00a0Brazil\\\\u2019s government has banned sodas, cakes\\\\u00a0and cookies in school meals. It has restricted the amount of salt and sugar in them as well. It also requires at least one daily serving of fruits and vegetables. Initially, students used to reject fresh food, says Martins. She and her colleagues hoped that the school garden would change that. \\\\u201cWe wanted to create better habits with this project,\\\\u201d Martins says. \\\\u201cWe wanted them to improve their eating and become healthier.\\\\u201d That idea is behind flourishing school gardens across Brazil. The program started 12 years ago as a pilot program in five schools, as part of a project by the United Nations Food and Agricultural Program. Today, there are a few thousand school gardens in 700 cities and towns. Many are run independently by schools. Others are supported by city governments.\\\\u00a0 It\\\\u2019s hard to know yet whether school gardens have improved children\\\\u2019s health, says Albaneide Peixinho, who ran Brazil\\\\u2019s school meal program for 13 years. But she says schools are reporting that the gardens have made students more aware of their food. \\\\u201cWith school gardens, they see that food comes from the Earth,\\\\u201d Peixinho says, and they are eating healthier. Some studies even show that the students are influencing how their families eat. \\\\u201cParents say that the kids are eating a lot of fruits and vegetables, and they insist on eating those foods at home.\\\\u201d  Sarah Campos (left) and Juliana Santos, former students of\\\\u00a0the Le\\\\u00e3o Machado School. Campos says she tried her first radish after working in the school garden. Now she loves them. Rhitu Chatterjee Sarah Campos, 14, took the school garden class last year at Le\\\\u00e3o Machado in S\\\\u00e3o Paulo. \\\\u201cI had never eaten radishes before,\\\\u201d she says. But she tried some when she and her classmates cooked radishes they had grown in the school garden. \\\\u201cI loved it so much that I even had a second plate,\\\\u201d Campos says. Now, she says she eats radishes often. \\\\u201cI ask my mom to make them for lunch sometimes. She puts them in the salad with carrots, and with potatoes. It\\\\u2019s very good.\\\\u201d She and her classmates say they are more open to eating vegetables now. They try to avoid fast food and they\\\\u2019re more conscious of their diets.Out in the garden, I ask Mateus, the student who told me about protecting earthworms, what he has learned in his gardening class. \\\\u201cMany things,\\\\u201d he says. \\\\u201cLike digging, what organic fertilizer is, what animals do to make the soil better.\\\\u201d \\\\u201cWhat did you learn about vegetables?\\\\u201d I ask. \\\\u201cThat they are good for our health and well-being.\\\\u201d \\\\u00a0 \\\\u201cDo you eat vegetables?\\\\u201d \\\\u201cI\\\\u2019m not so keen on them, but I guess I do now with this project,\\\\u201d he says, laughing sheepishly. \\\\u00a0 The hope is that by the end of the school year, he will really enjoy them.

During a primary season, that\\\\u2019s to be expected. Undoubtedly, it\\\\u2019s at this point during an election year when voters are most emotionally tied to a particular candidate. Primary elections often resemble sporting events more than political contests. But what\\\\u2019s alarmed me most about this particular primary season\\\\u00a0is the number of people threatening to \\\\u201csit out\\\\u201d or \\\\u201cwrite-in\\\\u201d a candidate if their particular candidate doesn\\\\u2019t happen to win the nomination. A belief that I think is one of the most asinine stances I\\\\u2019ve ever heard. If you think either Donald Trump, Ted Cruz or Marco Rubio would be better (or just as bad) as voting for either Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders, you are out of your damn mind. I don\\\\u2019t care what your thoughts are of either Clinton or Sanders, on their worst day, either candidate is a million times better than anyone from the Republican party. And with the rights for millions of Americans at risk, as well as the Supreme Court and our progress on climate change, there\\\\u2019s too much at stake this election to have any group of people not support the eventual Democratic nominee. And while I have encountered a few Clinton supporters who\\\\u2019ve vowed not to support Sanders if he becomes the nominee (I\\\\u2019ve even been blocked by a few of them for calling them idiots), the \\\\u201cmy candidate or no one\\\\u201d crowd is mostly found among Sanders supporters. Though I will gladly admit that the majority of those supporting Sanders do\\\\u00a0understand the bigger picture and have said they plan to support whichever candidate ultimately wins the nomination. To those people, I can\\\\u2019t thank them enough. In fact, I can\\\\u2019t thank anyone enough for realizing what\\\\u2019s on the line this election and why it\\\\u2019s so crucial that we all get out and \\\\u201cvote blue, no matter who.\\\\u201d I don\\\\u2019t even want to think about how much damage Republicans will be able to do to this nation if we hand them the White House this November. It will make George W. Bush\\\\u2019s eight years seem like a wonderful dream compared to the nightmare that a President Trump/Rubio/Cruz would inflict upon the country. But there\\\\u2019s an irony to anyone who says that they\\\\u2019re going to take their ball and go home if their candidate doesn\\\\u2019t win, and it\\\\u2019s this:\\\\u00a0Neither candidate can win without help from the supporters of their primary rival. If Hillary Clinton wins the nomination, then half of all Sanders supporters decide not to support her, she likely\\\\u00a0loses and we\\\\u2019re stuck with a President Trump/Rubio/Cruz. But guess what? If Bernie Sanders wins the nomination, then half of all Clinton supporters decide not to support him, he\\\\u2019s likely\\\\u00a0going to lose and we\\\\u2019re going to be stuck with a President Trump/Rubio/Cruz. The truth of the matter is, whether each side wants to admit it or not, they both need each other this\\\\u00a0November. Because come election day, if one group decides to let selfish ego and pride get in the way by not supporting the Democratic nominee, guess what? We all lose.\\\\u00a0 So, no matter what Clinton or Sanders supporters might think of one another, the reality is, they\\\\u2019re in this together \\\\u2013 whether they like it or not.

From LA Weekly: Sounds quite unspontaneous. But a law co-authored by L.A. state Sen.

People don\\\\u2019t sign a waiver when they\\\\u2019re engaging in any activity with someone they know and trust. (My advice to college kids: if you feel like you need to have a written contract drawn up with your \\\\u201cpartner,\\\\u201d you shouldn\\\\u2019t be having sex with them.)\\\\u00a0 Some of the colleges under investigation right now for mishandling sexual assault cases are the most liberal, anything-goes, sexually open institutions in America. They host extravagant \\\\u201cSex Week\\\\u201d events and pass out condoms to freshmen. They talk a lot about \\\\u201cconsent,\\\\u201d but very little about respect, caring, or good judgment.
