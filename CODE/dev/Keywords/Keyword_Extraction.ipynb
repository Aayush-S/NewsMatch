'<p>When explaining her decision to reevaluate Title IX guidelines as they pertain to sexual assault on college campuses, Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos <a

seriously. Every student accused of sexual misconduct must know that guilt is not predetermined.&#8221;</p> \\n\\n<p>The Obama administration&#8217;s changes to Title IX have been <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">criticized</a> for, among other things, substantially lowering the burden of proof as it pertains to sexual assault, as well as denying elements of due process to the accused.</p> \\n\\n<p>However, many progressives are lashing out at DeVos because they hate her, and also rape culture and stuff.</p> \\n\\n<p>Perhaps the most grotesque attack came when Rob Ranco, a Texas attorney, tweeted Friday that &#8220;I\\'m not wishing for it &#8230; but I\\'d be ok if #BetsyDevos was sexually assaulted. #Sexual Assault #TitleIX.&#8221;</p> \\n\\n<p><a href=\"http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/sep/9/rob-ranco-texas-lawyer-says-he-would-be-ok-if-bets/\" type=\"external\">The Washington Times</a> reports that in several other tweets (condensed for this publication), Ranco wrote: &#8220;Perhaps Betsy doesn&#8217;t understand how horrible rape is. She&#8217;s made the world more dangerous for my daughters. I need her to understand,&#8221; and &#8220;Make the world more dangerous for my daughters &#8212; intentionally &#8212; and your well being is not my concern. Full stop.&#8221;</p> \\n\\n<p>Ranco\\'s additional tweets don\\'t make his first one any less vile.</p> \\n\\n<p>In the wake of the overwhelming negative response, Ranco locked his Twitter profile, then <a href=\"https://www.redstate.com/brandon_morse/2017/09/09/cowardly-austin-lawyer-wished-sexual-assault-betsy-devos-locked-twitter-account/\" type=\"external\">deleted</a> it.</p> \\n\\n<p>Many on social media are calling for the attorney to be fired from The Carlson Law Firm, where he is a partner, or even disbarred:</p> \\n\\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/PrisonPlanet\" type=\"external\">@PrisonPlanet</a> I\\'m wishing for it... but I\\'d be ok if <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/RobRanco?src=hash\" type=\"external\">#RobRanco</a> was disbarred.</p> \\n\\n<p>As of this publication, the law firm&#8217;s Twitter account has also been locked, though Ranco is still listed on the official website&#8217;s &#8220; <a
