They\\\\u2019re armed with seeds, soil and a range of gardening tools. Upside-down soda bottles, filled with water, outline a series of rectangular garden plots. A boy named Felipy Pigato tells me they are preparing the soil for planting. \\\\u201cYesterday we mixed regular soil with coconut fiber,\\\\u201d he says. \\\\u201cThe coconut fiber holds the seeds in the soil.\\\\u201d \\\\u00a0 Today, he says they will add in the compost. As the students dig, they pull back chunks of dirt, creating shallow pits, where earthworms wriggle in the freshly dug soil.\\\\u00a0 Mateus Feitosa de Almeida, 12, slowly pulls back the soil around a worm. \\\\u201cWe have to pull like that so we don\\\\u2019t hurt the worms,\\\\u201d he explains. \\\\u201cIf we take them out, it\\\\u2019s bad for the soil.\\\\u201d This digging is going on in a quiet middle-class neighborhood, in a garden that belongs to Le\\\\u00e3o Machado School, a large public school. The students are working under the guidance of two teachers, Daniel Giglio Colombo and Marta Martins. This is the second year of the project, says Colombo, who helped start the garden. \\\\u201cWe\\\\u2019re going to grow the same things we did last year \\\\u2014 arugula, lettuce, radishes.\\\\u201d The vegetables they grow are used in school meals. But the real aim of the school garden is not to supply ingredients, he says, but to teach students where food comes from, so they can develop a connection to their food. \\\\u201cWhen we ask students where lettuce comes from, they say the market,\\\\u201d Colombo says. \\\\u201cThey have lost contact with nature, the soil, sowing, and growing of crops.\\\\u201d And that is reflected in their diets, he says, which are increasingly unhealthy.  Students say the school garden project is teaching them a lot about how to grow food, though it\\'s still hard for some of them to appreciate vegetables. Rhitu Chatterjee Just like in the US, highly processed foods like fast food, soda, and high-fructose corn syrup have become all too popular here in Brazil. And obesity rates are rising, even among children. It is a nation-wide problem that has alarmed the government and public health experts in the country.\\\\u00a0Brazil\\\\u2019s government has banned sodas, cakes\\\\u00a0and cookies in school meals. It has restricted the amount of salt and sugar in them as well. It also requires at least one daily serving of fruits and vegetables. Initially, students used to reject fresh food, says Martins. She and her colleagues hoped that the school garden would change that. \\\\u201cWe wanted to create better habits with this project,\\\\u201d Martins says. \\\\u201cWe wanted them to improve their eating and become healthier.\\\\u201d That idea is behind flourishing school gardens across Brazil. The program started 12 years ago as a pilot program in five schools, as part of a project by the United Nations Food and Agricultural Program. Today, there are a few thousand school gardens in 700 cities and towns. Many are run independently by schools. Others are supported by city governments.\\\\u00a0 It\\\\u2019s hard to know yet whether school gardens have improved children\\\\u2019s health, says Albaneide Peixinho, who ran Brazil\\\\u2019s school meal program for 13 years. But she says schools are reporting that the gardens have made students more aware of their food. \\\\u201cWith school gardens, they see that food comes from the Earth,\\\\u201d Peixinho says, and they are eating healthier. Some studies even show that the students are influencing how their families eat. \\\\u201cParents say that the kids are eating a lot of fruits and vegetables, and they insist on eating those foods at home.\\\\u201d  Sarah Campos (left) and Juliana Santos, former students of\\\\u00a0the Le\\\\u00e3o Machado School. Campos says she tried her first radish after working in the school garden. Now she loves them. Rhitu Chatterjee Sarah Campos, 14, took the school garden class last year at Le\\\\u00e3o Machado in S\\\\u00e3o Paulo. \\\\u201cI had never eaten radishes before,\\\\u201d she says. But she tried some when she and her classmates cooked radishes they had grown in the school garden. \\\\u201cI loved it so much that I even had a second plate,\\\\u201d Campos says. Now, she says she eats radishes often. \\\\u201cI ask my mom to make them for lunch sometimes. She puts them in the salad with carrots, and with potatoes. It\\\\u2019s very good.\\\\u201d She and her classmates say they are more open to eating vegetables now. They try to avoid fast food and they\\\\u2019re more conscious of their diets.Out in the garden, I ask Mateus, the student who told me about protecting earthworms, what he has learned in his gardening class. \\\\u201cMany things,\\\\u201d he says. \\\\u201cLike digging, what organic fertilizer is, what animals do to make the soil better.\\\\u201d \\\\u201cWhat did you learn about vegetables?\\\\u201d I ask. \\\\u201cThat they are good for our health and well-being.\\\\u201d \\\\u00a0 \\\\u201cDo you eat vegetables?\\\\u201d \\\\u201cI\\\\u2019m not so keen on them, but I guess I do now with this project,\\\\u201d he says, laughing sheepishly. \\\\u00a0 The hope is that by the end of the school year, he will really enjoy them.

During a primary season, that\\\\u2019s to be expected. Undoubtedly, it\\\\u2019s at this point during an election year when voters are most emotionally tied to a particular candidate. Primary elections often resemble sporting events more than political contests. But what\\\\u2019s alarmed me most about this particular primary season\\\\u00a0is the number of people threatening to \\\\u201csit out\\\\u201d or \\\\u201cwrite-in\\\\u201d a candidate if their particular candidate doesn\\\\u2019t happen to win the nomination. A belief that I think is one of the most asinine stances I\\\\u2019ve ever heard. If you think either Donald Trump, Ted Cruz or Marco Rubio would be better (or just as bad) as voting for either Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders, you are out of your damn mind. I don\\\\u2019t care what your thoughts are of either Clinton or Sanders, on their worst day, either candidate is a million times better than anyone from the Republican party. And with the rights for millions of Americans at risk, as well as the Supreme Court and our progress on climate change, there\\\\u2019s too much at stake this election to have any group of people not support the eventual Democratic nominee. And while I have encountered a few Clinton supporters who\\\\u2019ve vowed not to support Sanders if he becomes the nominee (I\\\\u2019ve even been blocked by a few of them for calling them idiots), the \\\\u201cmy candidate or no one\\\\u201d crowd is mostly found among Sanders supporters. Though I will gladly admit that the majority of those supporting Sanders do\\\\u00a0understand the bigger picture and have said they plan to support whichever candidate ultimately wins the nomination. To those people, I can\\\\u2019t thank them enough. In fact, I can\\\\u2019t thank anyone enough for realizing what\\\\u2019s on the line this election and why it\\\\u2019s so crucial that we all get out and \\\\u201cvote blue, no matter who.\\\\u201d I don\\\\u2019t even want to think about how much damage Republicans will be able to do to this nation if we hand them the White House this November. It will make George W. Bush\\\\u2019s eight years seem like a wonderful dream compared to the nightmare that a President Trump/Rubio/Cruz would inflict upon the country. But there\\\\u2019s an irony to anyone who says that they\\\\u2019re going to take their ball and go home if their candidate doesn\\\\u2019t win, and it\\\\u2019s this:\\\\u00a0Neither candidate can win without help from the supporters of their primary rival. If Hillary Clinton wins the nomination, then half of all Sanders supporters decide not to support her, she likely\\\\u00a0loses and we\\\\u2019re stuck with a President Trump/Rubio/Cruz. But guess what? If Bernie Sanders wins the nomination, then half of all Clinton supporters decide not to support him, he\\\\u2019s likely\\\\u00a0going to lose and we\\\\u2019re going to be stuck with a President Trump/Rubio/Cruz. The truth of the matter is, whether each side wants to admit it or not, they both need each other this\\\\u00a0November. Because come election day, if one group decides to let selfish ego and pride get in the way by not supporting the Democratic nominee, guess what? We all lose.\\\\u00a0 So, no matter what Clinton or Sanders supporters might think of one another, the reality is, they\\\\u2019re in this together \\\\u2013 whether they like it or not.

From LA Weekly: Sounds quite unspontaneous. But a law co-authored by L.A. state Sen.

People don\\\\u2019t sign a waiver when they\\\\u2019re engaging in any activity with someone they know and trust. (My advice to college kids: if you feel like you need to have a written contract drawn up with your \\\\u201cpartner,\\\\u201d you shouldn\\\\u2019t be having sex with them.)\\\\u00a0 Some of the colleges under investigation right now for mishandling sexual assault cases are the most liberal, anything-goes, sexually open institutions in America.

But when lawmakers start demanding that college students obtain “written or verbal consent” before having sex, it’s a sign we’ve become a tad hysterical on this issue.    From LA Weekly: Sounds quite unspontaneous. But a law co-authored by L.A. state Sen. Kevin de Leon would have state-run college campuses establish an “affirmative consent” standard for its students. \\xa0 According to the language of the bill, SB 967, students who want to have sex must essentially establish that there has been “an affirmative, unambiguous, and conscious decision by each participant to engage in mutually agreed-upon sexual activity.”…No more making sexy faces and sounds for you. You’ve got to verbalize. Or get it on paper. Why not just require a notarized letter from an attorney, or better yet, a license? If we’re going to go this far, maybe college kids who want to have sex should go to a DMV-like office to get permission.  All joking aside, the fact that this is even an issue suggests that a lot of college kids are having sex they’re not comfortable with having. People don’t sign a waiver when they’re engaging in any activity with someone they know and trust. (My advice to college kids: if you feel like you need to have a written contract drawn up with your “partner,” you shouldn’t be having sex with them.)\\xa0 Some of the colleges under investigation right now for mishandling sexual assault cases are the most liberal, anything-goes, sexually open institutions in America. They host extravagant “Sex Week” events and pass out condoms to freshmen. They talk a lot about “consent,” but very little about respect, caring, or good judgment. Plying a “yes” out of someone is all that matters. In an environment like this, the boundaries of consent begin to break down. Students—who face enormous peer pressure to participate in this free-for-all—have trouble saying “no” when they want to. Other students simply don’t respect a “no.” Add a huge amount of alcohol into the mix, and chaos ensues.  This is the problem that college administrators and lawmakers are trying to fix.

Earnings: Missed Where It Matters Most', 'Text': \" Based on the beating its stock price took out-of-the-gate following fiscal third-quarter earnings results, it's safe to say Palo Alto Networks investors and pundits were not amused. The problems with Palo Alto's recent quarter range from increased spending to poor guidance and slowing revenue growth. And to make matters worse, it's a healthy dose of all three. Continue Reading Below Despite landing on the wrong side of the earnings fence, Palo Alto responded positively in one of its primary initiatives: boosting its source of recurring revenue. However, as noted in a recent article Opens a New Window. leading up to the May 26 announcement, Palo Alto investors' patience was only going to be tested for so long. At some point the company needs to perform beyond growing its top line, and it's running out of time. CEO Mark McLaughlin tried to temper expectations after reporting Palo Alto's second-quarter results by forecasting a 43% to 45% revenue improvement in Q3, ending its nearly two-year-long streak of reporting 50% or more quarterly sales growth. Palo Alto didn't quite reach the remarkable 50% revenue jump this past (fiscal third) quarter, but delivered a pleasantly surprising 48% gain, to $345.8 million. Analysts had expected sales of $339.48 million. On the earnings-per-share front, Palo Alto hit its high-end forecast of $0.42 on a non-GAAP (excluding one-time items) basis, which also matched pundits' expectations. Fiscal Q3 billings rose a whopping 61% last quarter, to $486.2 million, which would seemingly be a positive sign of what is to come in the current fiscal Q4. But it is not to be. If not reaching 50% revenue growth is partly to blame for Palo Alto's stock price nosedive, its forecast for the current quarter will be downright depressing. On the high end of McLaughlin's forecast, Palo Alto expects 37% revenue growth to end its fiscal year, or $390 million. Advertisement On a more positive note, Palo Alto's services unit grew a whopping 63%, to $183.7 million, in Q3, and now represents 53% of total sales. Service sales, and the recurring revenue they generate, are a critical initiative for Palo Alto, and they took a step in the right direction last quarter. As noted before, Palo Alto has been on a spending spree for years to drive its stellar 50%-plus revenue jumps. But with growth beginning to slow -- Q3's results and this quarter's guidance are proof of that -- minimizing costs has become a necessity, not a nicety. The problem is, McLaughlin and team can't seem to keep their checkbooks in their pockets. A comparison with Palo Alto's peer and primary competitor,Check Point Software , demonstrates why the former's stock is down 26% year to date, and the latter's is up 3%. Palo Alto's total operating expenses of $309.5 million equaled 90% of sales. Check Point, on the other hand, spent 50% of last quarter's $404.3 million in revenue on its operating expenses. As for cost of revenue, Palo Alto spent $94.9 million to drive its product and services sales, more than twice Check Point Software's $45 million last quarter. Is it any wonder Check Point is profitable, on both a GAAP (including one-time items) and non-GAAP basis? And Check Point's profits continue to climb, too, rising 10% last quarter. Considering Palo Alto's slowing revenue growth and increased spending, it could be years before shareholders are in the black. Unfortunately, it gets worse because of the nature of Palo Alto's skyrocketing expenses. Check Point's sales and marketing costs equaled 23% of revenue in fiscal Q1, whereas Palo Alto's $202 million ate up a head-shaking 58% of its total sales last quarter. When investors add it all up, the answer is fairly straightforward: Slowing top-line growth was inevitable, but continuing to spend indiscriminately is not. Until McLaughlin reins in overheads, even improvement in services unit sales and the recurring revenue that comes with it won't be enough to placate shareholders. Nor should it be.

After escaping an abusive home in Central America where her sister was beaten by her parents for being pregnant, \"Jane Doe\" is facing a different kind of punishment in the country where she sought refuge. On Wednesday, a federal judge ruled to allow the pregnant teen access to an abortion.

Actually, it’s not really a guess, because curricula like that are found throughout the nation. The program that is being imposed on Winnetka, Ill., by contrast, is hard-left indoctrination that could have come straight from the pages of Howard Zinn. In 2016 it was held on MLK Day itself, but this year’s Seminar Day on race, “Understanding Today’s Struggle for Racial Civil Rights,” is scheduled for Tuesday, February 28. The all-school program will feature a full day of lectures and seminars, and as the title betrays, the slant is built in. As one of the parents who have protested the content noted, civil rights are for everyone, aren’t they? There are no “racial” rights. That was Martin Luther King’s point, or one of them. New Trier has scheduled two keynote speakers and dozens of seminars for the 4,000 students to choose among. One or two are unobjectionable, like “Black Gospel Music: Make a Joyful Noise!” or “Rap with a Social Conscience” (though much would depend upon which rap was discussed). But the rest of the offerings are thoroughly turgid agitprop. Students can attend a session titled “Seeing the Unseen: The Bias All Around You,” or learn to “recognize our own implicit biases.” They can attend seminars about “cultural appropriation,” “trans people of color navigating the U.S.,” “race, class, and police interactions,” “systemic racism in housing,” “myths” about affirmative action in college admissions, and “21st century voter suppression.” High-school students usually range in age from 14 to 18, so you might imagine that some care would be taken to avoid speakers whose social media are rife with profanity, racial epithets, and sexual content. No. Political radicalism means all is permitted. John the Author, one of the invited speakers, raps about “Blackenomics,” which includes the following lyrics: I don’t wanna be king, but I’m the only one ready for it now, Cause all these other niggas selling out, Individualism is all these motherf***ers yelling about Divide and conquer, white supremacy the silent monster One might have hoped, in a program dedicated to civil rights and mutual understanding, that the guests themselves might steer clear of racism and anti-Semitism. Kevin Coval’s poem “Occupation,” says this about Israel: “Fascist ones believe in one monotheism, a walled prison, Israelis sleep through the night.” Monica Trinidad will conduct a talk on “We Charge Genocide: An Emergence of a Continued Movement.” Her Twitter feed encourages people to boycott an Israeli dance troupe (“Don’t dance with apartheid!”) with a link to the BDS (boycott, divest, sanction) hashtag. She tweeted a picture of mounted police officers with the comment “Get them animals off those horses.” So, one might suppose that New Trier parents would be enraged. Yet the pushback has been about as polite, substantive, and reasonable as you could possibly wish (especially in our bitter era). On their website, parentsofnewtrier.org, they suggest adding other speakers to achieve — wait for it — intellectual diversity. They note that, in contrast to what the seminars hammer home, people of the same race do not necessarily think alike. Among the speakers the parents group recommends: Shelby Steele, Jason Riley, John McWhorter, and Star Parker. Rather than marinate in doctrinaire leftism heavily inflected with a Black Lives Matter sensibility, the parents object, why not have students volunteer for the day (Chicago is 16 miles south)? The website offers other volunteering suggestions: “Good News Partners (Rogers Park), Connections for the Homeless (Evanston), Pastor Corey Brooks from New Beginnings Church in Woodlawn and ‘ProjectHood.org.’” Despite multiple requests, school officials have refused every appeal from dismayed parents. No to additional speakers. No to adding another seminar at a later date for different viewpoints. No to requiring that parents sign off on their children’s seminar-panel choices. No to postponing the program until parental input could be considered. New Trier has very few black students, but the father of one wrote this: “This group [the small group of faculty and students who developed the program] does NOT represent the best of black Americans and does not advocate anything that has a track record of making black lives better.” These “check your privilege” brainwashing sessions have become commonplace at colleges. Parents don’t seem to know or care enough to protest. The New Trier parents group is a sign that resistance to deadening propaganda is alive and well — and polite. — Mona Charen is a senior fellow at the Ethics and Public Policy Center.

Much like they did the similar two times against Canada at the world junior hockey championship, the defending gold-medal-winning Americans overcame a two-goal deficit by scoring twice in a span of 34 seconds in the third period. \"It just made it better with the snow coming down and the fans\\' excitement. You could definitely feel it,\" Tkachuk said of a game played with snow persistently falling from the opening faceoff. \"We knew we were taking it to them in the second and third period and Coach was saying, if one goes in, two go in.\" A snowball effect, perhaps. And it happened in front of a world junior tournament record crowd of 44,592 — some going shirtless in celebrating the bitter elements — at the NFL Buffalo Bills\\' home, New Era Field. The Americans (1-1-1) showed resolve in not only beating their cross-border rivals, but overcoming the disappointment of a 3-2 loss to Slovakia on Thursday. \"That talks a lot about our group and the locker room and how close we are as a family,\" Bellows said. \"There was never a doubt in the whole entire locker room or on the bench at any point.\" Tkachuk and Ron Perunovich scored in the third period, while Casey Mittlestadt had three assists to take over the tournament lead with six points (two goals, four assists). Bellows scored his tournament leading fourth goal, and goalie Jake Oettinger stopped 19 shots through overtime and all four he faced in the shootout. Boris Katchouk, Cale Makar and Dillon Dube scored for Canada (2-0-1), which has lost four straight meeting to the Americans. It was a familiar and disappointing result for goalie Carter Hart, who was also lost the championship game to the U.S. in January. \"Last year doesn\\'t matter at all,\" said Hart, who stopped 32 shots through overtime Friday. \"Tomorrow, we get the chance to finish in first place, so that\\'s what on our mind\\'s now.\" By earning a point for the shootout loss, Canada still has the edge in the Group A standings in being two points ahead of the Americans. The Canadians can clinch top spot with a win in their preliminary round finale against Denmark (0-3) on Saturday. In the only other tournament game, St. Louis Blues draft pick Klim Kostin scored twice in leading Russia (2-1) to a 5-2 win over Belarus (0-3). Russia clinched a Group B berth in the quarterfinal round Tuesday. Belarus closes the preliminary round against the Czech Republic on Saturday and is in jeopardy of finishing last in five-team Group B standings. Bellows scored on the Americans\\' first shootout chance by snapping a shot through Hart\\'s legs. Then Tkachuk scored by firing a shot in the top right corner.

They’re armed with seeds, soil and a range of gardening tools. Upside-down soda bottles, filled with water, outline a series of rectangular garden plots. A boy named Felipy Pigato tells me they are preparing the soil for planting. “Yesterday we mixed regular soil with coconut fiber,” he says. “The coconut fiber holds the seeds in the soil.” \\xa0 Today, he says they will add in the compost. As the students dig, they pull back chunks of dirt, creating shallow pits, where earthworms wriggle in the freshly dug soil.\\xa0 Mateus Feitosa de Almeida, 12, slowly pulls back the soil around a worm. “We have to pull like that so we don’t hurt the worms,” he explains. “If we take them out, it’s bad for the soil.” This digging is going on in a quiet middle-class neighborhood, in a garden that belongs to Leão Machado School, a large public school. The students are working under the guidance of two teachers, Daniel Giglio Colombo and Marta Martins. This is the second year of the project, says Colombo, who helped start the garden. “We’re going to grow the same things we did last year — arugula, lettuce, radishes.” The vegetables they grow are used in school meals. But the real aim of the school garden is not to supply ingredients, he says, but to teach students where food comes from, so they can develop a connection to their food. “When we ask students where lettuce comes from, they say the market,” Colombo says. “They have lost contact with nature, the soil, sowing, and growing of crops.” And that is reflected in their diets, he says, which are increasingly unhealthy.  Students say the school garden project is teaching them a lot about how to grow food, though it's still hard for some of them to appreciate vegetables. Rhitu Chatterjee Just like in the US, highly processed foods like fast food, soda, and high-fructose corn syrup have become all too popular here in Brazil. And obesity rates are rising, even among children. It is a nation-wide problem that has alarmed the government and public health experts in the country.\\xa0Brazil’s government has banned sodas, cakes\\xa0and cookies in school meals. It has restricted the amount of salt and sugar in them as well. It also requires at least one daily serving of fruits and vegetables. Initially, students used to reject fresh food, says Martins. She and her colleagues hoped that the school garden would change that. “We wanted to create better habits with this project,” Martins says. “We wanted them to improve their eating and become healthier.” That idea is behind flourishing school gardens across Brazil. The program started 12 years ago as a pilot program in five schools, as part of a project by the United Nations Food and Agricultural Program. Today, there are a few thousand school gardens in 700 cities and towns. Many are run independently by schools. Others are supported by city governments.\\xa0 It’s hard to know yet whether school gardens have improved children’s health, says Albaneide Peixinho, who ran Brazil’s school meal program for 13 years. But she says schools are reporting that the gardens have made students more aware of their food. “With school gardens, they see that food comes from the Earth,” Peixinho says, and they are eating healthier. Some studies even show that the students are influencing how their families eat. “Parents say that the kids are eating a lot of fruits and vegetables, and they insist on eating those foods at home.”  Sarah Campos (left) and Juliana Santos, former students of\\xa0the Leão Machado School. Campos says she tried her first radish after working in the school garden. Now she loves them. Rhitu Chatterjee Sarah Campos, 14, took the school garden class last year at Leão Machado in São Paulo. “I had never eaten radishes before,” she says. But she tried some when she and her classmates cooked radishes they had grown in the school garden. “I loved it so much that I even had a second plate,” Campos says. Now, she says she eats radishes often. “I ask my mom to make them for lunch sometimes. She puts them in the salad with carrots, and with potatoes. It’s very good.” She and her classmates say they are more open to eating vegetables now. They try to avoid fast food and they’re more conscious of their diets.Out in the garden, I ask Mateus, the student who told me about protecting earthworms, what he has learned in his gardening class. “Many things,” he says. “Like digging, what organic fertilizer is, what animals do to make the soil better.” “What did you learn about vegetables?” I ask. “That they are good for our health and well-being.” \\xa0 “Do you eat vegetables?” “I’m not so keen on them, but I guess I do now with this project,” he says, laughing sheepishly. \\xa0 The hope is that by the end of the school year, he will really enjoy them.

The police threw the pregnant woman to the ground in the process of kicking down the door of the home they believed the suspect they were pursuing had just entered. Commentary by Jon Masters, As previously reported\\xa0she and her family were outside their apartment, and Abraham noticed the police, but all of a sudden they came rushing in. She said the person they were really looking for was in an adjacent building. Nevertheless, she attempted to tell the police that she had an 18-month old child sleeping in the bedroom. However, according to Abraham, they didn’t care. After one of the officers threw her to the ground, throwing her on her stomach, she began having contractions. “The doctor said the way that I landed, my body twisted the wrong way ’cause my left side hurts, and I landed all right here on my right side,” she said at the time of the incident. Once officers gained entry into the home, by kicking down the door, they apprehended her mother’s boyfriend. Police officers told her that her mother’s boyfriend looked like a car thief suspect they were pursuing. Her mother’s boyfriend had entered their apartment to get a glass of water just before police stormed in after him. Abraham went immediately to local\\xa0 News Channel Fox 40\\xa0to decry the treatment she received by those sworn to protect and serve her best interests. According to the news reports, police blamed Abraham for getting in the way. Sgt. Bryce Heinlein reflected on the events of the day telling reporters: At that point one of the officers grabbed the female by the arm. During that time she fell to the ground. Abraham scoffs at the notion she somehow fell down on her own accord. She responded: I have a baby in my stomach, I’m not fixing to just fall or exaggeratedly fall.\\xa0 I’m not fixing to do anything to harm my son. When asked if the actions of the officer who allegedly threw her to the ground where appropriate Heinlein said: To this day, Abraham maintains her innocence and says the whole home invasion/arrest of her mother’s boyfriend caught her off-guard. She rejects any notion that she and her family are somehow, someway, to blame for what happened when police mistook her mom’s boyfriend for their suspect. She said: I wasn’t in the way. I was telling them this is my home, trying to figure out what’s going on. I got a 1-year-old that lives here. We wasn’t doing nothing but minding our business that day. Making matters worse for Abraham, when police entered her apartment they kicked down the door and did not fix it. Luckily, however, neighbors were more helpful than police and actually nailed the frame back together while she was in the hospital. “I knew they were going to try to justify this whole thing. Right is right and wrong is wrong and. That was wrong what they did, all the way around,” said Abraham. As you watch the video below, remember, none of the people involved in this raid had committed a crime and no one was arrested — yet all their lives were put in danger thanks to the blatant incompetence of the police. \\xa0 Raw and Uncut video,', 'Bias': '3', 'Cluster Tags': \"{'Legal and Law Enforcement', 'Community Involvement'}\"}, {'article_id': 136, 'Keywords': \"['johnson', 'ashland', 'name', 'biggest', 'singles']\", 'Title': 'MOST ELIGIBLE SINGLES: Ashland Johnson', 'Text': 'Ashland Johnson (Washington Blade photo by Michael Key) Name: Ashland Johnson Age: 32 Occupation: Civil rights lawyer Identify as: Gay What are you looking for in a mate?

During a primary season, that’s to be expected. Undoubtedly, it’s at this point during an election year when voters are most emotionally tied to a particular candidate. Primary elections often resemble sporting events more than political contests. But what’s alarmed me most about this particular primary season\\xa0is the number of people threatening to “sit out” or “write-in” a candidate if their particular candidate doesn’t happen to win the nomination. A belief that I think is one of the most asinine stances I’ve ever heard. If you think either Donald Trump, Ted Cruz or Marco Rubio would be better (or just as bad) as voting for either Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders, you are out of your damn mind. I don’t care what your thoughts are of either Clinton or Sanders, on their worst day, either candidate is a million times better than anyone from the Republican party. And with the rights for millions of Americans at risk, as well as the Supreme Court and our progress on climate change, there’s too much at stake this election to have any group of people not support the eventual Democratic nominee. And while I have encountered a few Clinton supporters who’ve vowed not to support Sanders if he becomes the nominee (I’ve even been blocked by a few of them for calling them idiots), the “my candidate or no one” crowd is mostly found among Sanders supporters. Though I will gladly admit that the majority of those supporting Sanders do\\xa0understand the bigger picture and have said they plan to support whichever candidate ultimately wins the nomination. To those people, I can’t thank them enough. In fact, I can’t thank anyone enough for realizing what’s on the line this election and why it’s so crucial that we all get out and “vote blue, no matter who.” I don’t even want to think about how much damage Republicans will be able to do to this nation if we hand them the White House this November. It will make George W. Bush’s eight years seem like a wonderful dream compared to the nightmare that a President Trump/Rubio/Cruz would inflict upon the country. But there’s an irony to anyone who says that they’re going to take their ball and go home if their candidate doesn’t win, and it’s this:\\xa0Neither candidate can win without help from the supporters of their primary rival. If Hillary Clinton wins the nomination, then half of all Sanders supporters decide not to support her, she likely\\xa0loses and we’re stuck with a President Trump/Rubio/Cruz. But guess what? If Bernie Sanders wins the nomination, then half of all Clinton supporters decide not to support him, he’s likely\\xa0going to lose and we’re going to be stuck with a President Trump/Rubio/Cruz. The truth of the matter is, whether each side wants to admit it or not, they both need each other this\\xa0November.

About a quarter of a million young American men are already being abducted each year to fight the rapidly-escalating Vietnam War. \\xa0Many college students, however, are protected by their 2S student deferments, which blatantly discriminate against all those millions of other young men unable to afford college.\\xa0 As if this privileging of the relatively privileged were not sufficient, an outcry about “inequity” arises from administrations of some elite universities.\\xa0 Since the 2S deferment is contingent on relatively high class rank (meaning, of course, academic class rank), they argue that this unfairly discriminates against some of the “best” students, i. e., all those attending schools like Stanford.\\xa0 A man in the bottom quarter at an elite university might end up being drafted, even though he might be more “intelligent” than a man in the top quarter of some state college. To address such claims of injustice, the Selective Service was rolling out that month the College Qualification Test, a.k.a. the Selective Service Examination, an “objective” assessment of each test taker’s verbal and mathematical skills, to be used by local draft boards, together with college grades and class rank, to determine who was entitled to that precious 2S deferment and who should be shipped off to Vietnam.\\xa0\\xa0 But this deferment test actually spotlighted the true inequities of the draft.\\xa0 It also offered an opportunity for direct action against the war itself, right on the college campus. One of the many myths that have buried the true history of the Vietnam War is that the anti-war movement was motivated by selfish desire, especially among college students, to avoid the draft (a view that conveniently ignores the movement’s throngs of female participants, whose gender automatically exempted them from the draft).\\xa0 Quite to the contrary, students demonstrating against the draft deferment tests were specifically undermining and targeting their own privileges and exemptions, which, as they passionately argued, came at the expense of poor and working class people.\\xa0 At Stanford, a number of people actually disrupted the test.\\xa0 The young men involved thus proved that their goal was not to avoid the draft but to end it, since they had been explicitly warned that their actions would jeopardize their\\xa0own deferments.\\xa0 When students filed in to take the Selective Service test, other demonstrators handed them the SDS “alternative test” on the history of U.S.-Vietnam relations.\\xa0 About ninety students organized a sit-in in the President’s office.\\xa0 In a manifesto issued from the sit-in they denounced their own privileged status: “We oppose the administration of the Selective Service Examination . . . because it discriminates against those who by virtue of economic deprivation are at a severe disadvantage in taking such a test. . . . [The] less privileged, Negroes, Spanish-Americans, and poor whites, must fight a war in the name of principles such as freedom and equality of opportunity which their own nation has denied them.”\\xa0 “Conscription,” they declared, has throughout American history “invariably been biased in favor of the wealthy and privileged.” Enter young Mitt Romney, right on cue, waving a sign denouncing the anti-war students.\\xa0 \\xa0He, like his fellow almost all-male participants in this pro-war demonstration, fervently argued in support of the war and the draft.\\xa0 But not, of course, for himself. When Mitt enrolled at Stanford back in the spring of 1965, the official and overt U.S. war (as distinct from the previous forms of proxy, clandestine, and “adviser” warfare waged in Vietnam for more than a decade) had just begun.\\xa0 Operation Rolling Thunder, the sustained U.S. bombing of the north, had started on March 2.\\xa0 The first officially acknowledged U.S. combat units were the Marines who went ashore at Da Nang on March 8 (joining the 24,000 U.S. military personnel already fighting in Vietnam).\\xa0\\xa0 Draftees were not yet being used in combat.\\xa0\\xa0 So Mitt and his dad clearly intended the fall of 1965 to be the beginning of a fine four-year career at Stanford for the young man.\\xa0 But Mitt’s last month as a Stanford student was May 1966.\\xa0 Why? Although the Selective Service Exam radically reduced the chances of college men, especially those with the test-taking skills of most Stanford students, to be conscripted into the Vietnam War, it was no guarantee of long-lasting deferment.\\xa0 There were other, surer, escapes from the Vietnam nightmare.\\xa0\\xa0 One of the very best was the ministry.\\xa0 In 1966, young men flooded into divinity schools, embarking on careers to be ministers, priests, and rabbis.\\xa0 The Mormons had an even better deal than most religions, because The Church of Latter-Day Saints required each and every one of its young men to become, for at least two years, a “minister of religion.”\\xa0 \\xa0Thus all Mormon young men could claim deferments as ministers.\\xa0\\xa0 When the inequity of this arrangement became too blatant, the Selective Service entered into an agreement with the LDS that required the church to specify just one “minister” for each geographical district.\\xa0 Since there were relatively few Mormons in Michigan, and Governor George Romney had considerable influence in the church, Mitt quickly received an official appointment as a Mormon “minister of religion,” consecrated by a draft deferment from the Selective Service. \\xa0So instead of returning to Stanford, Mitt went off to become a Mormon missionary in France, where he would spend the next two and a half years—while Vietnam became a slaughterhouse for the Vietnamese and many Americans drafted to slaughter them. So who says that Mitt Romney is inconsistent?\\xa0 After all, what may have been his first recorded public political act was supporting the draft for ordinary Americans, forcing them to participate in a war waged in the interest of his own class.

He has taken it up as a pet cause of his to try and compel players who choose to take a knee during the anthem as a protest on behalf of African Americans to cease their protesting. In apparent response to reports about the NFL’s consideration of a rule compelling players to stand during the anthem — and thus stem the tide of distracting criticism produced by what’s turned into a PR debacle thanks to the president’s goading — Trump took to Twitter Wednesday to praise NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell for “demanding” that all players stand for the pre-game anthem. There is just one problem — according to the NFL, Trump got Goodell’s position dead wrong. A statement from the NFL, posted to Twitter by sports journalist Ian Rapoport, reads: ‘Commentary thus morning about the NFL Commissioner’s position on the anthem is not accurate. As we said yesterday, there will be a discussion of these issues at the owners meeting next week. The NFL is doing the hard work of trying to move from protest to progress, working to bring people together.’ Considering this statement from the NFL, Trump has yet again jumped ahead of the truth for the sake of his talking points. The statement from the NFL responding to Trump’s tweet details Goodell’s efforts to be privy to the concerns of players and potential ways to address those concerns. He reportedly spent Tuesday with the Miami Dolphins, “witnessing first hand the outstanding work our players and clubs are doing to strengthen our communities.” Considering Goodell’s past statements, he seems to be of the personal persuasion that all should stand for the anthem, but he is, apparently, among those who do not want to force their position on others. He is most certainly aware and concerned about, as mentioned, the hold that the controversy surrounding the anthem has put on efforts to address the underlying issues at play. Rather than allowing for a general conversation to proceed, the controversy, fueled in no small part by the president’s persistent belligerence, threatens to divide the league and its fans into ever more intense factions — and that’s not good for business.

Not too long ago, our little clan took a road trip from Los Angeles to Portland, Ore. Road trips are one of those mysterious things families feel compelled to do but no one knows why, like camping in the Mojave Desert or supporting the career of Miley Cyrus. I predict in the end it won’t be gay marriage that brings about the destruction of the American family. It will be the road trip. After getting the kids settled into the back seat of our Honda Odyssey with their DVD players and movies, we hit the freeway. Once out of L.A., I was finally able to sit back, pop open my laptop, and begin jotting down a few ideas for this column. That’s when Kelly woke from his nap and grabbed the steering wheel from me, babbling some nonsense about “safety” and not using my computer while driving. So we switched seats. Relocated to the passenger side, “safely,” I narrowed my list of possible topics to two: “Surviving Your Child’s K-Mart Taste” and “Parents I Hate.” Then suddenly — at 70 miles per hour — the transmission on our car blew out. And a column was born. I’m an American, a proud gay American who was raised to believe that bad things don’t happen to Hondas. Yet ours has blown two transmissions in five years. As we decelerated, the plume of smoke belching from underneath our hood began to panic my unflappable daughter. I tried to calm her as Kelly looked for a place to get off the road. “Think of it as an adventure, honey! We’re inside a fire-breathing dragon who just lost a leg!” She began to cry. Somehow we managed to limp across four lanes of traffic to the next exit and turn down a hill into the welcoming parking lot of a visitors center that overlooked a picturesque lake. A visitors center with bathrooms and vending machines and other kids to play with. A visitors center we soon noticed had a chain-link fence around it and a propped-up sign gloating, “Closed for Renovations.” “Look, an abandoned castle!” I tried, failing. We called AAA Roadside Assistance and waited. Turkeys cook faster. An hour and 40 minutes passed as my iPod faded from Gaga to gone and the sun sank deep into the lake. The battery on our cell phone now dead, our world turned pitch black and eerie quiet. When our Triple-A savior finally arrived on the scene, I could have jumped for joy. Instead, I froze. The white knight who showed up for our rescue turned out to be a physical composite of every high school bully I ever suffered: a tattooed skinhead-type, complete with soul-deadening stare and missing front tooth. I hesitantly approached the massive flatbed tow truck idling before me and handed up my membership card through the cab window. Barely looking up, he grunted, “You know we only tow free for seven miles. After that it’s 10 bucks a mile. You got about 15 miles to the next town.” I asked if he could fit a family of four in his cab. His shrug said he’d manage. After finishing his paperwork in silence, he finally lumbered down from his cab and stopped, getting his first, long look at my family. He stared at Kelly, then at me, then at our kids, finally speaking in the slow, guttural tones of a wife beater: “These kids y’all’s?” We answered that yes, they were. Traveling as a two-dad family can have its challenges. Twice a year we visit my parents in South Carolina, a state so welcoming that its constitution bans not only same-sex marriage and civil unions but birth control and bagels. On its face, California might seem an improvement, until you find yourself stranded in the dark off I-5 in one of those counties where Prop 8 passed with 98 percent of the vote. This man, whom I had now cast as the bastard love child of Ned Beatty and his horny hillbilly in the sequel to Deliverance, stared at us for what seemed a heart-thumping forever. Then he moved off. He spent the next few minutes hauling out huge, heavy chains with giant metal hooks. In my mind I pictured him encircling them around Kelly and me after he’d shot us, to more easily sink us to the bottom of that all-too-convenient lake. After attaching the giant hooks to our Odyssey — of course, to complete our family portrait and ensure our suspect status, we were two men driving a minivan — he moved to the side of his flatbed and began pulling mysterious levers that caused his vehicle to groan as it slowly tipped its flatbed to meet our homosexual automobile. This was too much for our youngest, James, a boy so Bam-Bam butch that for years we’ve referred to him as God’s joke on the gay daddies. By now he truly was jacked up by the adventure of it all. Biologically drawn to the smell of metal and grease like a moth to a blowtorch, James pushed forward and started peppering our AAA guy with questions: “Is our car dead?” “Do you have a bathroom in your truck?” “Who knocked out your tooth? Was it Batman?” At this point Kelly intervened: “James, stay back so he can do his work.” Mr. Triple-A stopped what he was doing and looked at us. “His name’s James? I got a boy named James.” He had six kids, he informed us, all named after famous people in the Bible. Of course you do, I thought. A home movie began unspooling in my mind, starring a toddler Moses and barefoot Bathsheba helping their brother Goliath blow up frogs by sticking firecrackers up their butts. Then he did something unexpected, something… perfect. This man whose menacing silence and sidelong glances had me rattled took off his work gloves and asked James to hold out his hands. He then began to gently pull the huge, oil-stained gloves over our son’s tiny fingers. Next he asked if James wanted to help him work the levers on the side of the flatbed so that he could haul our minivan up onto the truck. Mute with awe, James could only nod. As the chains grew taut and our car began to make its slow ascent up the ramp, James’ eyes widened to the size of the moon that had finally peeked through the clouds overhead. Before long we were all crowded into the cab of the tow truck for the ride to the nearest town. I never would have thought it possible, but somehow the five of us fit. My family was safe. Jesse — he had a Biblical name, too — pulled out his phone and handed it to us so we could see pictures of his family. As the glow from the faces of his wife and kids lit up the inside of the truck, he looked at Kelly and me and said, “So… did you guys get married when y’all had that little window a few years back, before the Prop 8 thing?” We said that we did. “That’s good,” he said. “My mom did, too,” he said. “She called up me and my brother and sister and told us, ‘Me and Maggie’s gonna have a wedding. You got a week and a half to figure out a way to get here.’” From there on out, this man I was so sure I had pegged continued to upend my preconceived notions. When he learned we live in Hollywood, he told us that as a teenager he’d been bused in from the suburbs, commuting 20 hours a week to attend the Hollywood High magnet program in theater arts. Theater arts? “Yep, it was great. For P.E. we took dance. Spent English readin’ Shakespeare. Instead of shop, we built sets for musicals. I loved it.” He never charged us the $80 he should have for the extra mileage. Instead, he directed us to the one motel in that truck-stop town that had a swimming pool for the kids. Then he advised us which mechanic to see the next morning and which taco stands to avoid. And before lowering our big, gay minivan into the parking lot of the auto shop, he stopped to put his gloves on our daughter so she could work the levers this time, sending her into a spiral of rapture. After that he offered to drive us to our motel. After we’d said our goodbyes and settled into our room, we made sure to sit the kids down and tell them how lucky our family had been that Jesse was the one sent to help us. Being kids, they got it: somehow the five of us fit. After Kelly and the kids fell asleep, I got curious and Googled the name Jesse. Turns out it’s Hebrew for “God’s gift.” \\xa0   Spilled Milk chronicles Bill’s misadventures in Daddyland.

Earnings: Missed Where It Matters Most\", \"Text\": \" Based on the beating its stock price took out-of-the-gate following fiscal third-quarter earnings results, it\\'s safe to say Palo Alto Networks investors and pundits were not amused. The problems with Palo Alto\\'s recent quarter range from increased spending to poor guidance and slowing revenue growth. And to make matters worse, it\\'s a healthy dose of all three. Continue Reading Below Despite landing on the wrong side of the earnings fence, Palo Alto responded positively in one of its primary initiatives: boosting its source of recurring revenue. However, as noted in a recent article Opens a New Window. leading up to the May 26 announcement, Palo Alto investors\\' patience was only going to be tested for so long. At some point the company needs to perform beyond growing its top line, and it\\'s running out of time. CEO Mark McLaughlin tried to temper expectations after reporting Palo Alto\\'s second-quarter results by forecasting a 43% to 45% revenue improvement in Q3, ending its nearly two-year-long streak of reporting 50% or more quarterly sales growth. Palo Alto didn\\'t quite reach the remarkable 50% revenue jump this past (fiscal third) quarter, but delivered a pleasantly surprising 48% gain, to $345.8 million. Analysts had expected sales of $339.48 million. On the earnings-per-share front, Palo Alto hit its high-end forecast of $0.42 on a non-GAAP (excluding one-time items) basis, which also matched pundits\\' expectations. Fiscal Q3 billings rose a whopping 61% last quarter, to $486.2 million, which would seemingly be a positive sign of what is to come in the current fiscal Q4. But it is not to be. If not reaching 50% revenue growth is partly to blame for Palo Alto\\'s stock price nosedive, its forecast for the current quarter will be downright depressing. On the high end of McLaughlin\\'s forecast, Palo Alto expects 37% revenue growth to end its fiscal year, or $390 million. Advertisement On a more positive note, Palo Alto\\'s services unit grew a whopping 63%, to $183.7 million, in Q3, and now represents 53% of total sales. Service sales, and the recurring revenue they generate, are a critical initiative for Palo Alto, and they took a step in the right direction last quarter. As noted before, Palo Alto has been on a spending spree for years to drive its stellar 50%-plus revenue jumps. But with growth beginning to slow -- Q3\\'s results and this quarter\\'s guidance are proof of that -- minimizing costs has become a necessity, not a nicety. The problem is, McLaughlin and team can\\'t seem to keep their checkbooks in their pockets. A comparison with Palo Alto\\'s peer and primary competitor,Check Point Software , demonstrates why the former\\'s stock is down 26% year to date, and the latter\\'s is up 3%. Palo Alto\\'s total operating expenses of $309.5 million equaled 90% of sales. Check Point, on the other hand, spent 50% of last quarter\\'s $404.3 million in revenue on its operating expenses. As for cost of revenue, Palo Alto spent $94.9 million to drive its product and services sales, more than twice Check Point Software\\'s $45 million last quarter. Is it any wonder Check Point is profitable, on both a GAAP (including one-time items) and non-GAAP basis? And Check Point\\'s profits continue to climb, too, rising 10% last quarter. Considering Palo Alto\\'s slowing revenue growth and increased spending, it could be years before shareholders are in the black. Unfortunately, it gets worse because of the nature of Palo Alto\\'s skyrocketing expenses. Check Point\\'s sales and marketing costs equaled 23% of revenue in fiscal Q1, whereas Palo Alto\\'s $202 million ate up a head-shaking 58% of its total sales last quarter. When investors add it all up, the answer is fairly straightforward: Slowing top-line growth was inevitable, but continuing to spend indiscriminately is not. Until McLaughlin reins in overheads, even improvement in services unit sales and the recurring revenue that comes with it won\\'t be enough to placate shareholders. Nor should it be.

After escaping an abusive home in Central America where her sister was beaten by her parents for being pregnant, \\\\\"Jane Doe\\\\\" is facing a different kind of punishment in the country where she sought refuge. On Wednesday, a federal judge ruled to allow the pregnant teen access to an abortion. But on Thursday, the US Court of Appeals issued a stay against that ruling, meaning the teen may be forced to carry her pregnancy to term. Jane Doe has until Oct. 31 to secure a sponsor, allowing her to be released from the custody of Health and Human Services (HHS). Two candidates have already been rejected as acceptable sponsors. On the deadline of Oct. 31, she will be about 18 weeks pregnant. Abortion is illegal in Texas after 20 weeks of pregnancy. Texas law also requires parental consent for minors seeking abortion care.

Actually, it\\\\u2019s not really a guess, because curricula like that are found throughout the nation. The program that is being imposed on Winnetka, Ill., by contrast, is hard-left indoctrination that could have come straight from the pages of Howard Zinn. In 2016 it was held on MLK Day itself, but this year\\\\u2019s Seminar Day on race, \\\\u201cUnderstanding Today\\\\u2019s Struggle for Racial Civil Rights,\\\\u201d is scheduled for Tuesday, February 28. The all-school program will feature a full day of lectures and seminars, and as the title betrays, the slant is built in. As one of the parents who have protested the content noted, civil rights are for everyone, aren\\\\u2019t they? There are no \\\\u201cracial\\\\u201d rights. That was Martin Luther King\\\\u2019s point, or one of them. New Trier has scheduled two keynote speakers and dozens of seminars for the 4,000 students to choose among. One or two are unobjectionable, like \\\\u201cBlack Gospel Music: Make a Joyful Noise!\\\\u201d or \\\\u201cRap with a Social Conscience\\\\u201d (though much would depend upon which rap was discussed). But the rest of the offerings are thoroughly turgid agitprop. Students can attend a session titled \\\\u201cSeeing the Unseen: The Bias All Around You,\\\\u201d or learn to \\\\u201crecognize our own implicit biases.\\\\u201d They can attend seminars about \\\\u201ccultural appropriation,\\\\u201d \\\\u201ctrans people of color navigating the U.S.,\\\\u201d \\\\u201crace, class, and police interactions,\\\\u201d \\\\u201csystemic racism in housing,\\\\u201d \\\\u201cmyths\\\\u201d about affirmative action in college admissions, and \\\\u201c21st century voter suppression.\\\\u201d High-school students usually range in age from 14 to 18, so you might imagine that some care would be taken to avoid speakers whose social media are rife with profanity, racial epithets, and sexual content. No. Political radicalism means all is permitted. John the Author, one of the invited speakers, raps about \\\\u201cBlackenomics,\\\\u201d which includes the following lyrics: I don\\\\u2019t wanna be king, but I\\\\u2019m the only one ready for it now, Cause all these other niggas selling out, Individualism is all these motherf***ers yelling about Divide and conquer, white supremacy the silent monster One might have hoped, in a program dedicated to civil rights and mutual understanding, that the guests themselves might steer clear of racism and anti-Semitism. Kevin Coval\\\\u2019s poem \\\\u201cOccupation,\\\\u201d says this about Israel: \\\\u201cFascist ones believe in one monotheism, a walled prison, Israelis sleep through the night.\\\\u201d Monica Trinidad will conduct a talk on \\\\u201cWe Charge Genocide: An Emergence of a Continued Movement.\\\\u201d Her Twitter feed encourages people to boycott an Israeli dance troupe (\\\\u201cDon\\\\u2019t dance with apartheid!\\\\u201d) with a link to the BDS (boycott, divest, sanction) hashtag. She tweeted a picture of mounted police officers with the comment \\\\u201cGet them animals off those horses.\\\\u201d So, one might suppose that New Trier parents would be enraged. Yet the pushback has been about as polite, substantive, and reasonable as you could possibly wish (especially in our bitter era). On their website, parentsofnewtrier.org, they suggest adding other speakers to achieve \\\\u2014 wait for it \\\\u2014 intellectual diversity. They note that, in contrast to what the seminars hammer home, people of the same race do not necessarily think alike. Among the speakers the parents group recommends: Shelby Steele, Jason Riley, John McWhorter, and Star Parker. Rather than marinate in doctrinaire leftism heavily inflected with a Black Lives Matter sensibility, the parents object, why not have students volunteer for the day (Chicago is 16 miles south)? The website offers other volunteering suggestions: \\\\u201cGood News Partners (Rogers Park), Connections for the Homeless (Evanston), Pastor Corey Brooks from New Beginnings Church in Woodlawn and \\\\u2018ProjectHood.org.\\\\u2019\\\\u201d Despite multiple requests, school officials have refused every appeal from dismayed parents. No to additional speakers. No to adding another seminar at a later date for different viewpoints. No to requiring that parents sign off on their children\\\\u2019s seminar-panel choices. No to postponing the program until parental input could be considered. New Trier has very few black students, but the father of one wrote this: \\\\u201cThis group [the small group of faculty and students who developed the program] does NOT represent the best of black Americans and does not advocate anything that has a track record of making black lives better.\\\\u201d These \\\\u201ccheck your privilege\\\\u201d brainwashing sessions have become commonplace at colleges. Parents don\\\\u2019t seem to know or care enough to protest. The New Trier parents group is a sign that resistance to deadening propaganda is alive and well \\\\u2014 and polite. \\\\u2014 Mona Charen is a senior fellow at the Ethics and Public Policy Center.

They\\\\u2019re armed with seeds, soil and a range of gardening tools. Upside-down soda bottles, filled with water, outline a series of rectangular garden plots. A boy named Felipy Pigato tells me they are preparing the soil for planting. \\\\u201cYesterday we mixed regular soil with coconut fiber,\\\\u201d he says. \\\\u201cThe coconut fiber holds the seeds in the soil.\\\\u201d \\\\u00a0 Today, he says they will add in the compost. As the students dig, they pull back chunks of dirt, creating shallow pits, where earthworms wriggle in the freshly dug soil.\\\\u00a0 Mateus Feitosa de Almeida, 12, slowly pulls back the soil around a worm. \\\\u201cWe have to pull like that so we don\\\\u2019t hurt the worms,\\\\u201d he explains. \\\\u201cIf we take them out, it\\\\u2019s bad for the soil.\\\\u201d This digging is going on in a quiet middle-class neighborhood, in a garden that belongs to Le\\\\u00e3o Machado School, a large public school. The students are working under the guidance of two teachers, Daniel Giglio Colombo and Marta Martins. This is the second year of the project, says Colombo, who helped start the garden. \\\\u201cWe\\\\u2019re going to grow the same things we did last year \\\\u2014 arugula, lettuce, radishes.\\\\u201d The vegetables they grow are used in school meals. But the real aim of the school garden is not to supply ingredients, he says, but to teach students where food comes from, so they can develop a connection to their food. \\\\u201cWhen we ask students where lettuce comes from, they say the market,\\\\u201d Colombo says. \\\\u201cThey have lost contact with nature, the soil, sowing, and growing of crops.\\\\u201d And that is reflected in their diets, he says, which are increasingly unhealthy.  Students say the school garden project is teaching them a lot about how to grow food, though it\\'s still hard for some of them to appreciate vegetables. Rhitu Chatterjee Just like in the US, highly processed foods like fast food, soda, and high-fructose corn syrup have become all too popular here in Brazil. And obesity rates are rising, even among children. It is a nation-wide problem that has alarmed the government and public health experts in the country.\\\\u00a0Brazil\\\\u2019s government has banned sodas, cakes\\\\u00a0and cookies in school meals. It has restricted the amount of salt and sugar in them as well. It also requires at least one daily serving of fruits and vegetables. Initially, students used to reject fresh food, says Martins. She and her colleagues hoped that the school garden would change that. \\\\u201cWe wanted to create better habits with this project,\\\\u201d Martins says. \\\\u201cWe wanted them to improve their eating and become healthier.\\\\u201d That idea is behind flourishing school gardens across Brazil. The program started 12 years ago as a pilot program in five schools, as part of a project by the United Nations Food and Agricultural Program. Today, there are a few thousand school gardens in 700 cities and towns. Many are run independently by schools. Others are supported by city governments.\\\\u00a0 It\\\\u2019s hard to know yet whether school gardens have improved children\\\\u2019s health, says Albaneide Peixinho, who ran Brazil\\\\u2019s school meal program for 13 years. But she says schools are reporting that the gardens have made students more aware of their food. \\\\u201cWith school gardens, they see that food comes from the Earth,\\\\u201d Peixinho says, and they are eating healthier. Some studies even show that the students are influencing how their families eat. \\\\u201cParents say that the kids are eating a lot of fruits and vegetables, and they insist on eating those foods at home.\\\\u201d  Sarah Campos (left) and Juliana Santos, former students of\\\\u00a0the Le\\\\u00e3o Machado School. Campos says she tried her first radish after working in the school garden. Now she loves them. Rhitu Chatterjee Sarah Campos, 14, took the school garden class last year at Le\\\\u00e3o Machado in S\\\\u00e3o Paulo. \\\\u201cI had never eaten radishes before,\\\\u201d she says. But she tried some when she and her classmates cooked radishes they had grown in the school garden. \\\\u201cI loved it so much that I even had a second plate,\\\\u201d Campos says. Now, she says she eats radishes often. \\\\u201cI ask my mom to make them for lunch sometimes. She puts them in the salad with carrots, and with potatoes. It\\\\u2019s very good.\\\\u201d She and her classmates say they are more open to eating vegetables now. They try to avoid fast food and they\\\\u2019re more conscious of their diets.Out in the garden, I ask Mateus, the student who told me about protecting earthworms, what he has learned in his gardening class. \\\\u201cMany things,\\\\u201d he says. \\\\u201cLike digging, what organic fertilizer is, what animals do to make the soil better.\\\\u201d \\\\u201cWhat did you learn about vegetables?\\\\u201d I ask. \\\\u201cThat they are good for our health and well-being.\\\\u201d \\\\u00a0 \\\\u201cDo you eat vegetables?\\\\u201d \\\\u201cI\\\\u2019m not so keen on them, but I guess I do now with this project,\\\\u201d he says, laughing sheepishly. \\\\u00a0 The hope is that by the end of the school year, he will really enjoy them.

The police threw the pregnant woman to the ground in the process of kicking down the door of the home they believed the suspect they were pursuing had just entered. Commentary by Jon Masters, As previously reported\\\\u00a0she and her family were outside their apartment, and Abraham noticed the police, but all of a sudden they came rushing in. She said the person they were really looking for was in an adjacent building. Nevertheless, she attempted to tell the police that she had an 18-month old child sleeping in the bedroom. However, according to Abraham, they didn\\\\u2019t care. After one of the officers threw her to the ground, throwing her on her stomach, she began having contractions. \\\\u201cThe doctor said the way that I landed, my body twisted the wrong way \\\\u2019cause my left side hurts, and I landed all right here on my right side,\\\\u201d she said at the time of the incident. Once officers gained entry into the home, by kicking down the door, they apprehended her mother\\\\u2019s boyfriend. Police officers told her that her mother\\\\u2019s boyfriend looked like a car thief suspect they were pursuing. Her mother\\\\u2019s boyfriend had entered their apartment to get a glass of water just before police stormed in after him. Abraham went immediately to local\\\\u00a0 News Channel Fox 40\\\\u00a0to decry the treatment she received by those sworn to protect and serve her best interests. According to the news reports, police blamed Abraham for getting in the way. Sgt. Bryce Heinlein reflected on the events of the day telling reporters: At that point one of the officers grabbed the female by the arm. During that time she fell to the ground. Abraham scoffs at the notion she somehow fell down on her own accord. She responded: I have a baby in my stomach, I\\\\u2019m not fixing to just fall or exaggeratedly fall.\\\\u00a0 I\\\\u2019m not fixing to do anything to harm my son. When asked if the actions of the officer who allegedly threw her to the ground where appropriate Heinlein said: To this day, Abraham maintains her innocence and says the whole home invasion/arrest of her mother\\\\u2019s boyfriend caught her off-guard. She rejects any notion that she and her family are somehow, someway, to blame for what happened when police mistook her mom\\\\u2019s boyfriend for their suspect. She said: I wasn\\\\u2019t in the way. I was telling them this is my home, trying to figure out what\\\\u2019s going on. I got a 1-year-old that lives here. We wasn\\\\u2019t doing nothing but minding our business that day. Making matters worse for Abraham, when police entered her apartment they kicked down the door and did not fix it. Luckily, however, neighbors were more helpful than police and actually nailed the frame back together while she was in the hospital. \\\\u201cI knew they were going to try to justify this whole thing. Right is right and wrong is wrong and. That was wrong what they did, all the way around,\\\\u201d said Abraham.

During a primary season, that\\\\u2019s to be expected. Undoubtedly, it\\\\u2019s at this point during an election year when voters are most emotionally tied to a particular candidate. Primary elections often resemble sporting events more than political contests. But what\\\\u2019s alarmed me most about this particular primary season\\\\u00a0is the number of people threatening to \\\\u201csit out\\\\u201d or \\\\u201cwrite-in\\\\u201d a candidate if their particular candidate doesn\\\\u2019t happen to win the nomination. A belief that I think is one of the most asinine stances I\\\\u2019ve ever heard. If you think either Donald Trump, Ted Cruz or Marco Rubio would be better (or just as bad) as voting for either Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders, you are out of your damn mind. I don\\\\u2019t care what your thoughts are of either Clinton or Sanders, on their worst day, either candidate is a million times better than anyone from the Republican party. And with the rights for millions of Americans at risk, as well as the Supreme Court and our progress on climate change, there\\\\u2019s too much at stake this election to have any group of people not support the eventual Democratic nominee. And while I have encountered a few Clinton supporters who\\\\u2019ve vowed not to support Sanders if he becomes the nominee (I\\\\u2019ve even been blocked by a few of them for calling them idiots), the \\\\u201cmy candidate or no one\\\\u201d crowd is mostly found among Sanders supporters. Though I will gladly admit that the majority of those supporting Sanders do\\\\u00a0understand the bigger picture and have said they plan to support whichever candidate ultimately wins the nomination. To those people, I can\\\\u2019t thank them enough. In fact, I can\\\\u2019t thank anyone enough for realizing what\\\\u2019s on the line this election and why it\\\\u2019s so crucial that we all get out and \\\\u201cvote blue, no matter who.\\\\u201d I don\\\\u2019t even want to think about how much damage Republicans will be able to do to this nation if we hand them the White House this November. It will make George W. Bush\\\\u2019s eight years seem like a wonderful dream compared to the nightmare that a President Trump/Rubio/Cruz would inflict upon the country. But there\\\\u2019s an irony to anyone who says that they\\\\u2019re going to take their ball and go home if their candidate doesn\\\\u2019t win, and it\\\\u2019s this:\\\\u00a0Neither candidate can win without help from the supporters of their primary rival. If Hillary Clinton wins the nomination, then half of all Sanders supporters decide not to support her, she likely\\\\u00a0loses and we\\\\u2019re stuck with a President Trump/Rubio/Cruz. But guess what? If Bernie Sanders wins the nomination, then half of all Clinton supporters decide not to support him, he\\\\u2019s likely\\\\u00a0going to lose and we\\\\u2019re going to be stuck with a President Trump/Rubio/Cruz.

About a quarter of a million young American men are already being abducted each year to fight the rapidly-escalating Vietnam War. \\\\u00a0Many college students, however, are protected by their 2S student deferments, which blatantly discriminate against all those millions of other young men unable to afford college.\\\\u00a0 As if this privileging of the relatively privileged were not sufficient, an outcry about \\\\u201cinequity\\\\u201d arises from administrations of some elite universities.\\\\u00a0 Since the 2S deferment is contingent on relatively high class rank (meaning, of course, academic class rank), they argue that this unfairly discriminates against some of the \\\\u201cbest\\\\u201d students, i. e., all those attending schools like Stanford.\\\\u00a0 A man in the bottom quarter at an elite university might end up being drafted, even though he might be more \\\\u201cintelligent\\\\u201d than a man in the top quarter of some state college. To address such claims of injustice, the Selective Service was rolling out that month the College Qualification Test, a.k.a. the Selective Service Examination, an \\\\u201cobjective\\\\u201d assessment of each test taker\\\\u2019s verbal and mathematical skills, to be used by local draft boards, together with college grades and class rank, to determine who was entitled to that precious 2S deferment and who should be shipped off to Vietnam.\\\\u00a0\\\\u00a0 But this deferment test actually spotlighted the true inequities of the draft.\\\\u00a0 It also offered an opportunity for direct action against the war itself, right on the college campus. One of the many myths that have buried the true history of the Vietnam War is that the anti-war movement was motivated by selfish desire, especially among college students, to avoid the draft (a view that conveniently ignores the movement\\\\u2019s throngs of female participants, whose gender automatically exempted them from the draft).\\\\u00a0 Quite to the contrary, students demonstrating against the draft deferment tests were specifically undermining and targeting their own privileges and exemptions, which, as they passionately argued, came at the expense of poor and working class people.\\\\u00a0 At Stanford, a number of people actually disrupted the test.\\\\u00a0 The young men involved thus proved that their goal was not to avoid the draft but to end it, since they had been explicitly warned that their actions would jeopardize their\\\\u00a0own deferments.\\\\u00a0 When students filed in to take the Selective Service test, other demonstrators handed them the SDS \\\\u201calternative test\\\\u201d on the history of U.S.-Vietnam relations.\\\\u00a0 About ninety students organized a sit-in in the President\\\\u2019s office.\\\\u00a0 In a manifesto issued from the sit-in they denounced their own privileged status: \\\\u201cWe oppose the administration of the Selective Service Examination . . . because it discriminates against those who by virtue of economic deprivation are at a severe disadvantage in taking such a test. . . . [The] less privileged, Negroes, Spanish-Americans, and poor whites, must fight a war in the name of principles such as freedom and equality of opportunity which their own nation has denied them.\\\\u201d\\\\u00a0 \\\\u201cConscription,\\\\u201d they declared, has throughout American history \\\\u201cinvariably been biased in favor of the wealthy and privileged.\\\\u201d Enter young Mitt Romney, right on cue, waving a sign denouncing the anti-war students.\\\\u00a0 \\\\u00a0He, like his fellow almost all-male participants in this pro-war demonstration, fervently argued in support of the war and the draft.\\\\u00a0 But not, of course, for himself. When Mitt enrolled at Stanford back in the spring of 1965, the official and overt U.S. war (as distinct from the previous forms of proxy, clandestine, and \\\\u201cadviser\\\\u201d warfare waged in Vietnam for more than a decade) had just begun.\\\\u00a0 Operation Rolling Thunder, the sustained U.S. bombing of the north, had started on March 2.\\\\u00a0 The first officially acknowledged U.S. combat units were the Marines who went ashore at Da Nang on March 8 (joining the 24,000 U.S. military personnel already fighting in Vietnam).\\\\u00a0\\\\u00a0 Draftees were not yet being used in combat.\\\\u00a0\\\\u00a0 So Mitt and his dad clearly intended the fall of 1965 to be the beginning of a fine four-year career at Stanford for the young man.\\\\u00a0 But Mitt\\\\u2019s last month as a Stanford student was May 1966.\\\\u00a0 Why? Although the Selective Service Exam radically reduced the chances of college men, especially those with the test-taking skills of most Stanford students, to be conscripted into the Vietnam War, it was no guarantee of long-lasting deferment.\\\\u00a0 There were other, surer, escapes from the Vietnam nightmare.\\\\u00a0\\\\u00a0 One of the very best was the ministry.\\\\u00a0 In 1966, young men flooded into divinity schools, embarking on careers to be ministers, priests, and rabbis.\\\\u00a0 The Mormons had an even better deal than most religions, because The Church of Latter-Day Saints required each and every one of its young men to become, for at least two years, a \\\\u201cminister of religion.\\\\u201d\\\\u00a0 \\\\u00a0Thus all Mormon young men could claim deferments as ministers.\\\\u00a0\\\\u00a0 When the inequity of this arrangement became too blatant, the Selective Service entered into an agreement with the LDS that required the church to specify just one \\\\u201cminister\\\\u201d for each geographical district.\\\\u00a0 Since there were relatively few Mormons in Michigan, and Governor George Romney had considerable influence in the church, Mitt quickly received an official appointment as a Mormon \\\\u201cminister of religion,\\\\u201d consecrated by a draft deferment from the Selective Service. \\\\u00a0So instead of returning to Stanford, Mitt went off to become a Mormon missionary in France, where he would spend the next two and a half years\\\\u2014while Vietnam became a slaughterhouse for the Vietnamese and many Americans drafted to slaughter them. So who says that Mitt Romney is inconsistent?\\\\u00a0 After all, what may have been his first recorded public political act was supporting the draft for ordinary Americans, forcing them to participate in a war waged in the interest of his own class.

That\\\\u2019s when Kelly woke from his nap and grabbed the steering wheel from me, babbling some nonsense about \\\\u201csafety\\\\u201d and not using my computer while driving.

I tried to calm her as Kelly looked for a place to get off the road. \\\\u201cThink of it as an adventure, honey! We\\\\u2019re inside a fire-breathing dragon who just lost a leg!\\\\u201d She began to cry. Somehow we managed to limp across four lanes of traffic to the next exit and turn down a hill into the welcoming parking lot of a visitors center that overlooked a picturesque lake.

We called AAA Roadside Assistance and waited. Turkeys cook faster. An hour and 40 minutes passed as my iPod faded from Gaga to gone and the sun sank deep into the lake. The battery on our cell phone now dead, our world turned pitch black and eerie quiet. When our Triple-A savior finally arrived on the scene, I could have jumped for joy. Instead, I froze. The white knight who showed up for our rescue turned out to be a physical composite of every high school bully I ever suffered: a tattooed skinhead-type, complete with soul-deadening stare and missing front tooth. I hesitantly approached the massive flatbed tow truck idling before me and handed up my membership card through the cab window. Barely looking up, he grunted, \\\\u201cYou know we only tow free for seven miles. After that it\\\\u2019s 10 bucks a mile. You got about 15 miles to the next town.\\\\u201d I asked if he could fit a family of four in his cab. His shrug said he\\\\u2019d manage. After finishing his paperwork in silence, he finally lumbered down from his cab and stopped, getting his first, long look at my family. He stared at Kelly, then at me, then at our kids, finally speaking in the slow, guttural tones of a wife beater: \\\\u201cThese kids y\\\\u2019all\\\\u2019s?\\\\u201d We answered that yes, they were.

This man, whom I had now cast as the bastard love child of Ned Beatty and his horny hillbilly in the sequel to Deliverance, stared at us for what seemed a heart-thumping forever. Then he moved off. He spent the next few minutes hauling out huge, heavy chains with giant metal hooks. In my mind I pictured him encircling them around Kelly and me after he\\\\u2019d shot us, to more easily sink us to the bottom of that all-too-convenient lake.

I got a boy named James.\\\\u201d He had six kids, he informed us, all named after famous people in the Bible. Of course you do, I thought. A home movie began unspooling in my mind, starring a toddler Moses and barefoot Bathsheba helping their brother Goliath blow up frogs by sticking firecrackers up their butts. Then he did something unexpected, something\\\\u2026 perfect. This man whose menacing silence and sidelong glances had me rattled took off his work gloves and asked James to hold out his hands. He then began to gently pull the huge, oil-stained gloves over our son\\\\u2019s tiny fingers. Next he asked if James wanted to help him work the levers on the side of the flatbed so that he could haul our minivan up onto the truck. Mute with awe, James could only nod. As the chains grew taut and our car began to make its slow ascent up the ramp, James\\\\u2019 eyes widened to the size of the moon that had finally peeked through the clouds overhead. Before long we were all crowded into the cab of the tow truck for the ride to the nearest town. I never would have thought it possible, but somehow the five of us fit. My family was safe. Jesse \\\\u2014 he had a Biblical name, too \\\\u2014 pulled out his phone and handed it to us so we could see pictures of his family. As the glow from the faces of his wife and kids lit up the inside of the truck, he looked at Kelly and me and said, \\\\u201cSo\\\\u2026 did you guys get married when y\\\\u2019all had that little window a few years back, before the Prop 8 thing?\\\\u201d We said that we did. \\\\u201cThat\\\\u2019s good,\\\\u201d he said. \\\\u201cMy mom did, too,\\\\u201d he said. \\\\u201cShe called up me and my brother and sister and told us, \\\\u2018Me and Maggie\\\\u2019s gonna have a wedding. You got a week and a half to figure out a way to get here.\\\\u2019\\\\u201d From there on out, this man I was so sure I had pegged continued to upend my preconceived notions. When he learned we live in Hollywood, he told us that as a teenager he\\\\u2019d been bused in from the suburbs, commuting 20 hours a week to attend the Hollywood High magnet program in theater arts. Theater arts? \\\\u201cYep, it was great. For P.E. we took dance. Spent English readin\\\\u2019 Shakespeare. Instead of shop, we built sets for musicals. I loved it.\\\\u201d He never charged us the $80 he should have for the extra mileage. Instead, he directed us to the one motel in that truck-stop town that had a swimming pool for the kids. Then he advised us which mechanic to see the next morning and which taco stands to avoid. And before lowering our big, gay minivan into the parking lot of the auto shop, he stopped to put his gloves on our daughter so she could work the levers this time, sending her into a spiral of rapture. After that he offered to drive us to our motel. After we\\\\u2019d said our goodbyes and settled into our room, we made sure to sit the kids down and tell them how lucky our family had been that Jesse was the one sent to help us. Being kids, they got it: somehow the five of us fit. After Kelly and the kids fell asleep, I got curious and Googled the name Jesse. Turns out it\\\\u2019s Hebrew for \\\\u201cGod\\\\u2019s gift.\\\\u201d \\\\u00a0   Spilled Milk chronicles Bill\\\\u2019s misadventures in Daddyland.
